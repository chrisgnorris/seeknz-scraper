# seeknz-scraper
Using Python to scrape Seek NZ based on user preferences


## Version 1
#### Run and configure using:
main('operations-analyst','Auckland') 

All spaces will need a dash between them. 


#### Next steps for development:
1. Make it ignore queries it has already done - so it can run daily (DONE)
2. Add in more info (i.e date etc) (DONE)
3. Add in better salary data
4. Save to an existing Excel file for better usability - i.e make it append as opposed to overwriting (maybe move to Pycharm) 
5. Mine job requirements and keywords
6. Recommend jobs
